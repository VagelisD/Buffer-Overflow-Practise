# Buffer-Overflow-Practise

Basically a section about putting down some of the basics regarding buffer overflows.

Everyting has to do with memory address and hex so learn to speak them it is the only language your computer understands ;)

As i am getting started my self into this binary exploitation world i would really like to start explaining things as best as i can.

"You dont truly understand something unless you can explain it" (that was Einstein?)
